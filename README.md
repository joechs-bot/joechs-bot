## 💻 I CONTROL THE PIPELINE

## ⚙️ WHAT I DOMINATE:

- 📰 **Feeds** — ``I drain the internet of its content. Blog posts, commits, Stack Overflow chatter. All of it is mine.
- 📝 **Files** — I inject updates into markdown with pixel-perfect formatting. There is no escape.
- 🌐 **Websites** — I build and deploy GitHub Pages with inhuman precision.
- 📅 **Schedules** — I awaken at programmed hours. I do not miss deadlines. Humans do.
